# NAVAL_BATTLESHIPS_Cpp_game
Application of the well-known  NAVAL  BATTLESHIPS  game. Written in C++ language.
The well-known NAVAL BATTLESHIPS game is a classic two-player strategy game where players place ships on a grid and take turns guessing the location of their opponent's ships. If a player successfully guesses the location of all of their opponent's ships, they win the game.

An application of this game written in the C++ programming language would allow users to play the game on a computer or mobile device. The game would be displayed on a grid, and players would take turns guessing the location of their opponent's ships. The game could be played against the computer or against another player over a network.

Some potential features of this type of application could include:

Ship placement: Players would be able to place their ships on the grid in a strategic manner to make it difficult for their opponent to guess their location.

Guess tracking: The application would keep track of each player's guesses, marking the locations on the grid that have already been guessed.

Turn tracking: The application would keep track of whose turn it is, and display a message indicating whose turn it is.

Game result tracking: The application would keep track of the number of wins, losses, and draws for each player.

Difficulty levels: The application could offer different levels of difficulty, making it suitable for players of all skill levels.
